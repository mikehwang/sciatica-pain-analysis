# Sciatica Pain Analysis

This project entails an analysis of a *pain* log that was kept for about 3 weeks from 2016-05-23 to 2016-06-10.  The purpose of the log plus analysis is to help determine if the pain is getting worse and to help assist in the decision making of getting surgery.

## What was logged?

The existence of pain was logged and broken down into pain types (e.g. aching, sharp, tingling) and pain areas (e.g. calf, buttock, back).

## How were entries logged?

A best effort was taken to log entries consistently: consistently in frequency and consistently in unbias collection.  The records were kept in a Google Sheet because:

1. The file could be accessed easily from many devies which lowers the challenge in data collection
2. The hotkey `Ctrl - :` (prints current date) and `Ctrl - Shift - :` (prints current local time) are crucial in recording time easier and consistent

Some columns were added in the middle of the data collection period because new sensations were observed.  The previous records were marked as zero when columns are added rather than a blank or a `NA`.
